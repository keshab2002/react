# 📒 Notes: **The Need for Hooks in React**

---

## ❓ What Are Hooks?

**Hooks** are special functions introduced in **React 16.8** that let you “hook into” React features like **state**, **lifecycle**, and **context** — **inside functional components**.

Before hooks, you could only use these features in **class components**.

---

## 🤔 Why Were Hooks Introduced?

### 🧨 Problem #1: Functional Components Had No State

Before hooks, functional components were *stateless* — they couldn't remember anything between renders.

```jsx
// ❌ Can't have state here before hooks
function Counter() {
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count); // updates but doesn't re-render
  }

  return <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>;
}
```

Even though `count` is incremented, the UI doesn’t update because React doesn't know it needs to re-render.

---

### 🧨 Problem #2: Class Components Were Complicated

* Needed `constructor`, `this.state`, `this.setState`
* Binding methods (`this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)`)
* Messy lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.)

```jsx
// ✅ But too verbose
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.increment}>{this.state.count}</button>;
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Solution: Hooks

Hooks bring **state and lifecycle features to functional components**, making code **simpler, shorter, and more reusable**.

---

## 🎯 Example: useState Hook

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ✅ useState hook

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1); // ✅ Triggers re-render
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={increment}>
      You clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

> `useState(0)` creates a `count` state variable with initial value `0`, and a function `setCount` to update it.

---

## 🎯 Example: useEffect Hook

Hooks can also replace lifecycle methods using `useEffect`.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval); // cleanup
  }, []); // runs only once (like componentDidMount)

  return <p>Time passed: {seconds}s</p>;
}
```

## 🧠 Other Common Hooks

| Hook          | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Manage local component state           |
| `useEffect`   | Side effects (fetching, timers, etc.)  |
| `useContext`  | Access context values                  |
| `useRef`      | Mutable ref (DOM access, timers, etc.) |
| `useMemo`     | Memoize expensive calculations         |
| `useCallback` | Memoize functions                      |
| `useReducer`  | Complex state logic (like Redux)       |

---

## 🚀 Benefits of Hooks

* Write less code with **functional components**
* **Reusability**: Custom hooks let you extract and reuse logic
* Better separation of concerns
* Easier to test and read

---

### ✅ Summary

Hooks:

* Solve limitations of functional components
* Simplify state management and side effects
* Make code cleaner and more modular
