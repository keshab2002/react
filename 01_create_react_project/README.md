Here's a detailed explanation of **how React works internally**, followed by a **comparison of file structures** and internal workings of React when using **Create React App (CRA)** vs **Vite + React**:

## 🔍 How React Works Internally

React is a **UI library** that builds and manages the UI based on component hierarchies and a virtual representation of the DOM.

### ⚙️ 1. **Component-Based Architecture**

* Each UI block is a **component** (a function or class that returns JSX).
* Components can hold **state** and accept **props**.
* React uses a **tree structure** of these components to form your UI.

### ⚙️ 2. **JSX to JavaScript**

* JSX is syntactic sugar. It’s transpiled to `React.createElement()` using Babel.
* Example:

  ```jsx
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  ```

  becomes:

  ```js
  React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello')
  ```

### ⚙️ 3. **Virtual DOM**

* React builds a **virtual DOM** (an in-memory representation of the real DOM).
* When state or props change:

  * React re-renders the affected component.
  * It **diffs** the old vs new virtual DOM.
  * Then it applies **minimal updates** to the real DOM — a process known as **reconciliation**.

### ⚙️ 4. **React Fiber**

* React uses a **Fiber architecture** — a reimplementation of its core algorithm that breaks work into units and schedules updates efficiently.
* Enables features like **concurrent rendering**, **suspense**, and **interruptible updates**.

### ⚙️ 5. **Hooks System**

* Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) are used to manage side effects, state, and lifecycle in function components.
* Internally, hooks use **linked lists** to track state per component render.

## 📁 File Structure & Internal Setup: CRA vs Vite + React

### 🏗️ **Create React App (CRA)**

#### Folder Structure

```bash
my-app/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
```

#### Internal Tooling:

* **Bundler**: Webpack
* **Transpiler**: Babel
* **Linting**: ESLint
* **Dev Server**: Webpack Dev Server
* **Configuration**: Hidden unless you eject (`npm run eject`)

#### Pros:

* Batteries-included
* Widely supported
* Good for beginners

#### Cons:

* Slower dev server
* Difficult to customize without ejecting
* Legacy tooling (Webpack/Babel combo)

### ⚡ **Vite + React**

#### Folder Structure

```bash
my-app/
├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
├── index.html
├── vite.config.js
├── package.json
```

#### Internal Tooling:

* **Bundler**: Rollup (for production)
* **Transpiler**: ESBuild (for dev — very fast)
* **Dev Server**: Native ES module dev server
* **Configuration**: Easily editable via `vite.config.js`

#### Pros:

* Super-fast dev startup
* Modular and minimal by default
* Easier to configure
* Modern JS features supported out-of-the-box

#### Cons:

* Requires setup for full features (e.g., testing, linting)
* Smaller community (though growing fast)
* Needs manual configuration for complex setups

## 🧠 Summary

* **React itself** behaves the same in both CRA and Vite — it renders components, manages state, and updates the UI using the Virtual DOM and Fiber architecture.
* The **major difference lies in the build tools and development experience**:

  * **CRA** gives you everything out of the box, but hides configuration.
  * **Vite** is lighter, faster, and easier to customize, but expects you to set up extras as needed.
